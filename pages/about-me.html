            <h2>The Story Behind the Screen</h2>
            <p>
                I am a multidisciplinary visual artist and designer driven by curiosity and a commitment to storytelling. My creative journey began in the visual arts and has grown through a desire to connect more deeply with my own cultural roots as well as those of others. Drawing from this background and a constant pursuit of growth, I create work that merges global perspectives with contemporary digital media.
            </p>
            <p>
                I thrive at the intersection of technical skill and creative vision. Whether I’m building intricate websites or designing bold visual graphics, my goal is always to craft polished, impactful experiences that solve a client’s problem with both style and precision.
